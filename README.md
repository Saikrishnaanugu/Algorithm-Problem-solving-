## Algorithmic Problem-Solving

# Description:
This repository contains solutions to various algorithmic problems implemented in Java. Each problem is approached using different algorithms and techniques such as brute force, greedy algorithms, and dynamic programming. Each solution is accompanied by detailed explanations of the problem statement, the approach used to solve it, and the implementation code.
